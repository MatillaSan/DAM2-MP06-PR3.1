    <title>The treasure in One Piece is at the end of the Grand Line. But isn't that the same as the beginning?</title>
    <score>83</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;I think that the One Piece, being at the end of the Grand Line, simply refers to the fact that to get to the "One Piece", the legendary treasure talked about by the last Pirate King, you will need to travel to the "end" of the seas. In this case, that means traveling through the most remote/dangerous places so that only the worthy can get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why does absorbing the Spirit Wave from Genkai involve such a painful process?</title>
    <score>14</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;Spirit Energy is a part of one's life energy, like an extension of one's soul.  When Genkai transfers her spirit energy into Yusuke to teach him the technique, it is incredibly painful for him to receive such an overwhelming amount of energy/soul at once because his body takes  time to adjust to the new levels of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What's the significance of the watermelon in Sora no Otoshimono?</title>
    <score>12</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;I believe there is no significance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is just a character trait that she really likes watermelons. Probably for their smooth and round shape.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What software are used by anime studios?</title>
    <score>11</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;It depends on a few different things, including the content, the style, and when it was made (i.e. did the technology exist to do it one way vs. another?) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://youtu.be/YibyPAsCCJE" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Here's a GREAT example of multiple anime styles used in a single show --&lt;/a&gt; we go from "high quality" level animation for the transformations, to the more "western", flash-friendly style the show is normally in, to a rather garish live-action explosion at the end. These all require different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you pay attention, you can also spot where the characters aren't moving much in certain points in the video (like where Panty &amp;amp; Stocking are standing still under the "disco" lighting), so they can get away with only drawing the frame once even though the scene goes for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When "tweening" between keyframes (to produce moving animation like your soccer ball example), yes, those have to be hand-drawn -- or at least hand-checked, even if a computer is used to extrapolate between keyframes! Using certain animation software like &lt;a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.toonboom.com" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Toon Boom&lt;/a&gt;, or 3D modeling software like &lt;a href="http://www.blender.org/" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; may take out some of the work, but none of that software can compensate for a bad animator, or replace an artist at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There's plenty of shortcuts animators use, but the computer never draws the cartoon for them -- they still have to do that part themselves!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why is SSJ3 shown as tiring to maintain, but SSJ4 is not?</title>
    <score>25</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;Don't forget that GT is a filler, it wasn't created by the original creator, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_Toriyama"&gt;Akira Toriyama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a very high probability that is was overlooked. Also if I remember correctly, SSJ3 wasn't shown as tiresome in Dragon Ball GT.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How can Madara still stick around even after the Edo Tensei had been ended?</title>
    <score>19</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;From what I understood, if you know the Edo Tensei technique yourself, and you're resurrected, you can &lt;em&gt;use it on yourself, after the technique was dismissed by the original caster&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; So actually, what Madara Uchiha did was use Edo Tensei again, using the original sacrifice Kabuto gave him, so that he is now the new caster, and he revived himself.
 Like Madara said on &lt;strong&gt;Chpater 591 page 17&lt;/strong&gt;, there is one risk to the technique.

 &lt;em&gt;If you know the seal, you can release the summoning contract itself.&lt;/em&gt;
 Basically, freeing you from the caster's control. Madara's soul wasn't bound by Kabuto anymore, but by himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tell them not to use forbidden jutsu so lightly next time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>List of surviving Uchiha</title>
    <score>14</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;The following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uchiha Itachi&lt;/strong&gt; - Who performed the massacre. Was killed later by Sasuke (according to his plan), then reanimated, eventually to die again (permanently, this time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uchiha Sasuke&lt;/strong&gt; - Who was spared by Itachi in hopes of making him strong. Still alive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's about it from the traditional ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Madara Uchiha&lt;/strong&gt; - Who was dead during the massacre, was also later reanimated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uchiha Obito also survived the massacre, in fact, he helped Itachi execute it (as Tobi).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;And also&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="spoiler"&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Sarada_Uchiha" rel="noreferrer"&gt;Sarada Uchiha&lt;/a&gt;, Sasuke's and Sakura's daughter, also counts for the purposes of this list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the significance of Ran's birthday?</title>
    <score>11</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;Officially, neither the birthday is revealed, nor has it really played a role in the plot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Aoyama said in an interview, that there is an &amp;quot;obstacle&amp;quot; preventing him from revealing Ran's birth date, but since the birthday hasn't passed Ran is 16 right now&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview, quoted from &lt;a href="http://www.detectiveconanworld.com/forum/topic/346-birthdays/?do=findComment&amp;amp;comment=288267" rel="nofollow noreferrer"&gt;Detective Conan World's forum&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;蘭の誕生日教えて！→差し支えあるので今は言えない。でもまだ誕生日来ていないので蘭は現在16歳。&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tell me about Ran's birthday! → Since there's an obstacle, I can't tell it for now. But since the birthday hasn't passed, Ran is 16 right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that a future volume will be about her birthday, so everything else would be wild speculation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Do people who use the Death Note become Shinigami themselves?</title>
    <score>48</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Humans who die don't go to Heaven or Hell (because neither exists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They go to &lt;a href="http://deathnote.wikia.com/wiki/Mu"&gt;Mu&lt;/a&gt; (Which means, nothing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death Note, Volume 12&lt;/strong&gt;, page &lt;em&gt;188&lt;/em&gt;, has these two rules in regards to
  "Mu": "All humans will, without exception, eventually die." Also,
  "After they die, the place they go is MU (Nothingness)."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, there's nothing after death. Shinigami are a different species.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Does Deimon win the Christmas bowl?</title>
    <score>9</score>
    <topAnswer>
      <body>&lt;p&gt;There is in fact an Eyeshield 21 manga, which continues the story further than the anime. The anime ends on chapter 239 of the manga, while the manga continues to chapter 333. The manga doesn't go as far as professional football, but the last chapter does end with a similar scenario at the college level.&lt;/p&gt;
